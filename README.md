# 157A-SpartEx
## Contributors: Janani Pandurangan and Gunraj Singh

SpartEx aims to provide a platform for SJSU students to list textbooks, appliances, and furniture to sell within the Spartan Community. Its simple yet user-friendly interface allows students to connect using their listed social media handles for efficient and cost-effective transactions. Our focus was to create a community-driven ecosystem that simplifies the process of exchanging used items among students.

# Important Note:
We have discussed with Professor Zare about our application being hosted locally. Since we are unable to host the website or share the sql connection password, Professor Zare recommended that we share screenshots with the program flow. We have uploaded a video (attached below) which goes over the program flow, including the code, database, and starting the website locally.
