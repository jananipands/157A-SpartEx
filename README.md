# 157A-SpartEx

SpartEx aims to provide a platform for SJSU students to list textbooks, appliances, and furniture to sell within the Spartan Community. Its simple yet user-friendly interface allows students to connect using their listed social media handles for efficient and cost-effective transactions. Our focus was to create a community-driven ecosystem that simplifies the process of exchanging used items among students.
